# Ceasar Cipher

This topic talks about the Ceasar Cipher, a simple symmetric encryption technique. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, A would be replaced by D, B would become E, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.

## Files

- [basic.py](./basic.py): This file contains the complete basic implementation of the Ceasar Cipher in Python. It encrypts and decrypts a message.
- [basic-encrypt.py](./basic-encrypt.py): This file encrypts a message by asking for the key and plaintext. It then prints the ciphertext.
- [basic-decrypt.py](./basic-decrypt.py): This file decrypts a message by asking for the key and ciphertext. It then prints the plaintext.
- [basic-bruteforce.py](./basic-bruteforce.py): This file brute force decrypts a message without asking for the key. It prints all possible plaintexts.
